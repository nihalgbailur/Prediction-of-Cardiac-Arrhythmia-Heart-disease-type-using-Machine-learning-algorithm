# Prediction of Cardiac Arrhythmia Heart disease type using Machine learning algorithm

Cardiac Arrhythmia is a disease dealing with improper beating of heart. The improper condition may be fast beating or slow beating associated with heart. Cardiac Arrhythmia is a of a group of conditions in which the electrical activity of the heart is irregular or is faster or slower than normal. Detection or prediction scheme in the type of cardiac arrhythmia disease It is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the world. In this project, I predict Cardiac Arrhythmia based on a patient’s medical record. Our objective is to classify a patient into one of the Arrhythmia classes like Tachycardia and Bradycardia based on his ECG measurements and help in understanding the application of machine learning in medical domain. After appropriate feature selection and by using Machine Learning Algorithms namely K Nearest Neighbour, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes and SVM . I have reached at a conclusion, about what type of cardiac arrhythmia it is. The proposed method
achieves an overall accuracy of 80%, when compared with various other existing approaches.
